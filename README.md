# User Story

As someone who hangs out mostly in groups, I want to create an app for users to create an outing with different friends. Users are able to enter input items, prices and payer for that trip before calculating the total amount split among them. This app requires the user to settle up first by restricting users to only one trip at a time.

# How to use

1. Create a trip by inputting trip name and companions
2. Add the item, price and payer for each transaction
3. Click on calculate to derive how much each person owes one another
