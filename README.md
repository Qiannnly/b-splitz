# User Story

This bill-splitting app is handy for those who engage in pairs or in groups and are seeking to remove the hassle of dividing costs fairly with other contributors to the activity. This app is convenient when we dine out with friends, purchase gifts, or even sharing household expenditures like utilities, house maintenances, chores, fuels with housemates. This can help avoid unnecessary disagreements when the bill splitting feature simplifies the process of dividing costs equally. Each activity created is only meant for that specific activity and contributors. Users will have to re-enter all activity details after splitting.
